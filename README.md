# Time-Masters-Inc.
This project was produced in the course Advanced Web Design with CSS3. The focus of the project was the coding, not the design. This website is for a fictional time-traveling safari business. On the home page, an advanced slider (CSS3 and HTML5) is applied to showcase various creatures from various time periods. Music also plays in the background (HTML5). The navigation menu (CSS3 and HTML5) on the left-hand side brings you to each page which features creatures from that specific time period. Both the advanced slider and navigation menu feature a short animation that changes color to indicate that they are active (CSS3). On three of the pages, sounds are applied to the creatures (HTML5).
