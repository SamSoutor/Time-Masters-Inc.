On our fifth stop through time, we will be traveling to Montana in the Cretaceous period.
This was the final period when dinosaurs walked the Earth and some of the most famous
species showed up during this time. North America was different during the Cretaceous.
The West and East Coasts are developing while the center of the United States of America 
is completely sub-merged underwater. Beneath the waves lie killers ranging from mosasaurs,
plesiosaurs and even sharks. Since I'll be providing the information on the dinosaurs, 
Time Masters Inc. has given you the opportunity to listen to what they sound like in the 
wild.

The top predator of the Cretaceous is considered to be the deadliest
sea monster that ever lived. Tylosaurus is one of the largest mosasaurs
of its time and because of this, open water dives are strictly
prohibited. I should also point out that this creature is related to
snakes because it moves side-to-side in the water. To ensure that you
get a good look at this beast, we have installed cameras on different
parts of the tour boat for viewing.

<div class="description5">
You probably may have seen this creature in books, but I should mention
that some people believe The Loch Ness Monster is an Elasmosaurus that
survived extinction. If you can't see Nessie in Scotland, at least you'll
get to see what inspired her appearance. Elasmosaurus would often travel
in squads to catch schools of fish that weren't so lucky. On the tour,
watch for a squad on the cameras because these creatures can move fast.

<div class="description6">
How about we talk about something that isn't dangerous in the Cretaceous
seas. If you're a fan of sea turtles back home, I'm sure you will enjoy
seeing this one. Archelon is the largest sea turtle to ever exist in
this time period and like modern turtles today, it would feed on
Jellyfish. Perhaps we'll see one come up for air on the tour.
