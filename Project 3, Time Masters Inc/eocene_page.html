On our sixth stop through time, we will take a stop in the mangrove environment of the
Eocene period. As you will see, much time has passed since the dinosaurs walked the Earth.
In their place, the mammals have emerged as the new age known as the Cenozoic is beginning
to replace the Mesozoic era. The location that we will be stopping at is a mangrove that
will one day become the Sahara Desert. In the trees above, primates leap from branch to
branch. On the beach, large mammals forage for food. Out at sea, large whales are the top
predators. The Dorudon image below was taken in the wild by our professional
photographer.

A primitive monkey that jumped from tree to tree, Apidium was quite
possibly one of the very first of its kind. Evolving from the
nocturnal Godinotia, Apidium lived in mangrove environments where
it foraged for fruit and stayed in the trees to avoid being eaten
by predators below. As we traverse the mangroves, look above to see
it leap in the same way that modern monkeys do today.

<div class="description2">
How about we talk about something bigger in the mangrove. It may
look like a rhino, but the Arsinoitherium is directly related to
elephants. Though it is a large mammal with an aggressive appearance,
I think you should know that Arsinoitherium is a gentle giant. Mostly
a swimmer, Arsinoitherium would sometimes come onto land in order to
mate or find feeding grounds. Perhaps on the tour you could feed one
a fruit.

<div class="description3">
This relative of the elephant is smaller than the Arsinoitherium, but
I'm sure many of you will find it interesting as well. Moeritherium is
semi-aquatic because it would often swim in rivers around the mangrove
environments to find food in the riverbed. Moeritherium is not very fast
on land or in the water, but I'm sure you will have plenty of time to
observe them for yourself.

<div class="img">

<div class="description4">
Farther out from the mangroves is a large predator that belongs to a
family of creatures many of you would consider to be gentle, the whales.
Basilosaurus was the first giant whale to roam the seas and was considered
the top predator of its time. This species of whale didn't have a
blow-hole and had to get air by raising its nose to the surface. Its
diet consisted of fish, sharks, squid, turtles and other marine
mammals such as Dorudon. To get a good look at this whale, we have
created a speaker to draw any nearby for whale watching.

<div class="description5">
Basilosaurus is not the only whale in the Eocene period, there is also
Dorudon. This species of whale is smaller and often travels in groups
to protect their young. This is similar to how dolphins are today. Like
Basilosaurus, Dorudon had no blow-hole. I should mention that this whale
is very fast, so it has an advantage over the larger whales. On the tour,
you will have to watch and see it jump out of the water for the thrill of
the adventure.
