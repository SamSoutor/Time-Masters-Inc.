<div class="description-top">On our second stop through time, we 
will be traveling to the Devonian period. Due to complications with 
Time Masters Inc., I am not at liberty to discuss the location of 
where we will be stopping. I think you will find that this time 
period has more to it than the Ordovician did. On the land we have 
plants and amphibians, but in the water we have sharks and some 
terrifying fish. Due to the danger that some of these species 
possess, we have prepared an anti-shark cage so you can get close 
to the creatures. Other than that, welcome to The Age of Fish. Some of the images
were taken in the wild by our professional photographer.

<div class="description1">To those of you who didn't think that the 
Orthocones were scary, I think you will find the next sea monster 
to have your heart in your mouth. Dunkleosteus was considered to 
be the top predator of its time and you can see why. Part of an 
extinct family of fish known as placoderms, Dunkleosteus was a 
heavily armoured fish that showed no mercy to whatever it hunted. 
Instead of teeth, it had sharp bony plates which could cut through 
the toughest fish. We have tested chain mail on this monster with 
live bait and not even that is immune to its powerful bite. Those 
who have heart conditions or suffer from panic attacks should consult 
our medical advisor before viewing this magnificent fish.

<div class="description2">We said that there were sharks in this 
time period, don't worry they won't harm you because these sharks 
are primitive. One such species is Stethacanthus. Often called the
"Ironing Board" because of its strange fin, this shark used its fin 
for mating rituals and to frighten off potential predators. We can't 
risk open water dives with these creatures because there is a 
chance that a hungry Dunkleosteus could take you down.

<div class="description3">Around river banks farther inland, you 
will find a predatory fish that can feast on all amphibians and 
sharks that cross paths with it. Called Hyneria, it is a large 
lobe-finned fish that has the ability to propel itself onto land 
using strong short fins. It also has an air bladder that acts as 
primitive lungs to survive in oxygen deprived waters. If we're 
lucky, we could see one catch a Hynerpeton while on the tour.

<div class="description4">Not only are there fish in the Devonian, 
there are also amphibians. Say hello to Hynerpeton, one of the first 
vertebrate animals to live and move on the land. This amphibian had 
to make sure that its skin was wet because if the skin were to dry 
out, they would die. Fortunately at night, they could spend more time 
on land. Life was not 
easy for Hynerpeton because predators such as 
Stethacanthus and Hyneria would often hunt them down. Like most 
amphibians, the eggs of Hynerpeton had to be laid in the water. 
If you spot one on the tour, make sure to not startle them.
