<div class="description-top">On our fourth stop through time, we will
truly see more dinosaurs in the flesh during the Jurassic period. This
time period is considered to be the era when the dinosaurs became the
dominant creatures of the Earth. Species such as Allosaurus, Diplodocus
and Stegosaurus were some of the biggest to ever walk during the Jurassic.
Out at sea, prehistoric sea monsters reigned supreme. Since I'll be 
providing the information on the dinosaurs, Time Masters Inc. has 
given you the opportunity to listen to what they sound like in the 
wild. The Stegosaurus image was taken in the wild by our professional photographer.

The apex predator of the Jurassic seas, Liopleurodon was feared by
all sea creatures including sharks. With large jaws and a sense of
smell that makes other predators seem inferior, this sea monster showed
no mercy. To make sure that no adults attack us on the tour, we've 
installed an advanced system which releases a mixture of chemicals
to drive them away.
</div>

<div class="description5">
Back home we have saltwater crocodiles, here we have Metriorhynchus.
A marine crocodile that would often scavenge large carcasses or hunt
small marine life, this predator lived under the shadow of Liopleurodon.
It also has a fish-like tail which it moved side-to-side. This is 
similar to how modern crocodiles move. To keep them from attacking you
out at sea, make sure to use a prod.
</div>

<div class="description6">
While there may be marine reptiles, there are also fish in the Jurassic
seas. The biggest of them would have to be the Leedsichthys. These fish
would travel in groups to feast on plankton. If one of them fell behind,
they would become targets to the predators that lurked in the deep.
Open water dives with these creatures should be safe, just make sure
that you don't fall behind the group, otherwise you'll be seen by
Liopleurodon as a snack.
