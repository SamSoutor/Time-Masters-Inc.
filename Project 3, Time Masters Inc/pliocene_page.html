<div class="description-top">On our final and seventh stop through 
time, we will be traveling to South America to see the unique mammals 
that evolved as a result of the Great American Interchange. The location
where most of these creatures lie is in ancient Paraguay. Giant ground
sloths, terror birds and large cats are some of the pre-Ice Age beasts
before the mammoths came to dominate the land. Out at sea lies a massive
monster shark and whales ranging from big to small. Though some of you
might request seeing the Ice Ages after this time period, I'm afraid that
this is as far as Time Masters Inc. will allow on the tour.

<div class="description1">
Strange huh? A mammal that has a unique appearance is sure to fascinate you. While we 
travel the grasslands, you will see herds of Macrauchenia run in the same way that herds
of Zebra do today. These herbivores would often outrun predators such as Smilodon or
Phorusrhacos, sometimes they would even use their back legs to deliver powerful kicks. You
will also notice that Macrauchenia has a trunk. Despite that, it is not related to
elephants.

<div class="description2">
Not an ordinary sloth, but a giant one. That's the best way to describe
Megatherium in its entirety. Weighing more than modern elephants, these giant ground
sloths would often use their huge claws to forage for food at heights unreachable to other
herbivores. These claws were also used as weapons for defense against predators such as
Smilodon. In case one comes in our direction, we'll move the tour vehicle so that it
doesn't view us as a threat.

<div class="img">

</div>

<div class="description3">
A predator that was both fast and aggressive towards its prey, the
flightless Phorusrhacos has another name; Terror Bird. These birds
would prey upon helpless young animals and would scavenge carcasses
of full-grown animals. The Smilodon were considered their rivals on the
plains of Paraguay and would often clash with them. Let's hope they
don't chase anyone down while on the tour.
</div>

<div class="img">

<div class="description4">
You'll know this predator when you witness it live. The sabre-tooth
cat known as Smilodon is the mightiest creature to have ever lived
in ancient South America. Though originally from North America, this
cat arrived in South America when the two continents merged with each
other. Like lions today, a single male would look over his pride and
have cubs with the females. Some males often bear scars from their battles
with rivals. Give a shout-out if you see a half-tooth male wandering the
plains of Paraguay on the tour.

<div class="description5">
We know what you'll say out at sea with this monster; "You're gonna
need a bigger boat." For those of you who have a fear of sharks, we 
advise you to remain calm at all times. Megalodon is the biggest
carnivorous fish that ever lived and it lived up to this name by
feasting on the large whales out in open water. Due to safety concerns,
we have employed professional divers to use shark cages to get live
underwater footage for the tour guests.

</div>

<div class="description6">
Before we head out to open water to find megalodon, we'll have to start
the second half of the tour in shallow water. Young megalodon are common,
but you'll also find other creatures such as the odobenocetops more friendly.
Like narwhals, odobenocetops has sharp tusks which it used for mating
rituals or to forage for food. They are startled easily, so be careful
when you approach them for a visit.
