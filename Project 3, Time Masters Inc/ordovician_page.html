<div class="description-top">On our first stop through time, we 
will be traveling to New York in the Ordovician period. During this 
time in pre-history, the Earth is much different than the one you 
know. Days are only 21 hours long and there is more carbon dioxide 
in the atmosphere than there is oxygen. To help prepare for this, 
Time Masters Inc. has developed specialized bio-suits equipped with 
a special air mixture to help you breathe. Once you step onto the 
land you will notice something very quickly; there is no life around. 
The reason for this is because the animals that live in the sea 
haven't evolved yet. It won't be until the
 Devonian period when this 
change happens. Until then, you will enjoy seeing species such as 
Orthocones, Sea Scorpions and Trilobites.

<div class="description">While this species of Orthocone known as 
Cameroceras is not the world's first sea monster, it certainly will 
stand out as the biggest of it's time. Don't worry, it won't harm us 
when you take the dive out to sea. As the top predator of Ordovician 
seas, Cameroceras often had to use its tentacles to catch sea 
scorpions and trilobites. Once the prey was caught, the Orthocone 
would use its beak to crush them to bits. The modern day equivalent 
to this creature would be the Giant Squid.

<div class="description2">Did you know that scorpions used to be in 
the sea before they came on land and shrunk in size? This specific 
species called Megalograptus was one of many during the age before 
the dinosaurs. Belonging to a group of marine arthropods called 
eurypterids, they lacked a stinger but used their sharp spines to 
attack prey such as trilobites. You will see plenty of them on shore 
and in the water while on the tour.
