<div class="description-top">On our third stop through time, we will
be stopping in the ancient supercontinent of Pangaea. The Triassic
was the time when the dinosaurs first appeared on the Earth. As they
began to reign the Earth, other creatures co-existed with them. In the
water, other creatures started out as the world's sea monsters before
evolution created real prehistoric monsters of the Mesozoic. Since 
I'll be providing the information on the dinosaurs and other creatures
of this time period, Time Masters Inc. has given you the opportunity 
to listen to what they sound like in the wild. Some of the images were taken in the wild
by our professional photographer.

Though primitive, Cymbospondylus is one of the largest ichthyosaurus to ever exist. See
the tail of this creature? Cymbospondylus would often use it to achieve great speed in
order to catch prey both in shallow and deep water. Unlike other marine life,
Cymbospondylus gave birth to live young. This is a trait that dolphins and whales have
today. If this creature comes to close to you while on the tour, make sure to use a prod
to keep it at bay.

<div class="description5">
A common marine reptile, Nothosaurus was quite the sight back in its day. This creature
is semi-aquatic because it would sometimes come on to land, but it mostly spent time in
the water where it hunted for fish. Once prey is caught in a Nothosaur's grip, there is
no escape. There is something risky you could try on the tour, if you grab one by the jaws,
then you'll have a ride with it through the water. Make sure it goes up for air though.
</div>

<div class="description6">
Take a look at this. With a long neck and tail, Tanystropheus had the greatest length of
any marine reptile during this time period. Though perfect for ambush predators, this
marine reptile has an advantage. If a predator catches the tail, Tanystropheus will drop
it like modern lizards do. Don't worry, the tail will grow back. We highly advise you to
not disturb these creatures because we don't want any tails dropped.
